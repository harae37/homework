# Voice / Speech Recognition Technology


Speech recognition is literally speech recognition done by computers. The audio input is recorded and transformed into waveforms, and by analyzing the waveform with specific algorithms, computers translate the audio waves into text or any other output expected depending on what context it is being used at.
Speech recognition's main purpose is to able other forms of input than type for the computer. This makes using computers convenient in certain situations.

The way speech recognition functions is that audio input is transformed into waves, and that wave is chopped into tiny pieces in units of phonemes. Then using algorithms, the phonemes are put together into a likely word. These words are then assembled in a language context using the machine's language understanding. Depending on what it is being used for, the next steps may involve other technologies.


The first speech recognition was made in the Bell Laboratories in 1952. This very first version however, could only understand numbers spoken by one person.
The Harpy System developed by Carnegie Mellon in the 1970s could recognize thousands of words spoken by different people, using the pronunciation network.
In the 1980s, with the Hidden Markov Model's invention, voice recognition became almost like the today's technology. (Further research needed)
