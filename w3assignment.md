#### Q1. What is a 'flame war' and what does it have to do with emoticons? What's the difference between an emoticon and an emoji?

flame war
: a lengthy exchange of angry or abusive messages between users of an online forum or other discussion area.

Back in the late 1900s when online communication like online bulletin boards became more and more used, the posts were highly text based and this led to many misinterpretation of the posts, like taking a joke too seriously or not taking seriously a serious content. This often led to people getting offended and fighting each other verbally on the web (flame war) and as a method to reduce such misinterpretation, emoticons were officially introduced in such web environments so that people could tell if someone was being silly or serious in their posts. Using an easy, small visual element helped people understand the context better.

Emoticon is a short for emotion icon. It is made out of letters, numbers, and punctuation marks, so basically typographical display made out of a combination of ASCII symbols. :-)

Emojis, on the other hand, does not require tilting the head to read it. Made in Japan first like a landscape version of emoticons, like (^-^), now emojis mean the actual tiny images. It is a character set extension of Unicode.

#### Q2. Boulton explains that a JPEG file has 'lossy' compression. Explain what this means. List and explain a few other kinds of image file compression and the image file types associated with them.

A lossy compression filetype discards data when saving to compress the file size smaller. It has an algorithm that discards the specific part of the data in a specific order, like the color information and chunking the pixels. So everytime a JPEG file is saved, it keeps losing data, leading to low resolution with a small size.

There are lossless compression methods, and depending on which filetype the used algorithm is different. TGA, BMP, TIFF uses the run-length encoding and is capable of preserving very high resolution, huge files. GIF and PNG are also lossless filetypes, even though they use different algorithms.

#### Q3. List and explain a few examples of metadata beyond the examples given in the book.

The information in electronic chips in pets provide metadata like the address and the information of the animal.

Web URLs and title, author, date written in an article in a news website is metadata.

The account name, account ID, and time/date posted in a tweet is metadata.

Time and place taken in the photo app of Iphones are metadata. This also shows who's in the picture.
