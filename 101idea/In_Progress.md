### Title (provisional): Go on, I'm listening...

This piece is planned to be vector illustration of everyday manifesting of speech recognition. I chose to make a vector illustration because of the connotation this style brings. Graphic vector illustrations are very common in our daily lives these days, and it also brings a sense of reliance to the subject matter of the illustration because of the neatness of the style and the professional qualities it requires. I thought that this would be a perfect match to express speech recognition, because even though speech recognition is around us all the time we don't realize it in a significant way. I think both the tech and this style of work carry out their roles in a subtle way and helps adding richness to the experience of technology and art in our daily lives.
