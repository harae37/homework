### Voice Recognition

A lot of horrible things happened today. I was trying to leave work early for some other stuff I have to work on, and on the way back my boss requested me to send some important documents to the client. I was feeling kind of bad for leaving early when the company was really busy, but this was a planned thing. So I just thought this would make up some of the work I missed out, so I said I will. Will, my boss, said it was urgent and would appreciate it to be sent as soon as possible. Like in 20 minutes. I was waiting for my train, and the platform was super crowded because of this stupid event or something. It was too crowded me to type, so I just decided to use my headphone and voice type the email. I got my new phone last week, so I thought it would be quick and accurate and all that. That was a huge mistake. The words were all wrong—so I had to fix them a multiple times, which was very annoying. Then it kept recognizing this other dude on the train’s voice and type that too. At this point I was already on the train. I looked for any mistakes like 5 times (should have done more but I was too annoyed and impatient because of the crowd), but as soon as I noticed the weirdest typo the train pulled a stop, shook, my finger slipped and sent the mail. I don’t want to go to work tomorrow.

I got a new car. I’ve been driving for a while but this car is supposed to be super helpful for me. It detects sounds from outside the car like the siren or any other cars beeping super sensitively and shows it on the front window. So even though I can’t hear, I can see everything going around. Also because I have my phone to help with, I can understand what other people in the car are telling me in a safer way because it shows in text. And it’s supposed to get used to my accent and all that the more I use it, so it pretty much understands what I say as well. Now I can safely drive by myself without having someone to supervise me or drive for me.
