# W6 assignment

1. Bulletin Board Systems (BBS) weren't just used by people with specific interests. There were of course, BBSs for specific topics, but there were also some local community BBSs. One example is the Koala Country. Koala Country was a BBS for anyone in Sydney from 1989 to 1995. It was not run by the government or any other local autonomy but by an individual in Sydney. Koala Country did not have a specific topic, but it was used to leave messages for people in the local community, share information and files, and also some online games. It is shut now because the person running it decided to spend more time with family, but he still has the modem and if connected it would still be the same form as it was in 1995.

2. After Yahoo announced that they are shutting GeoCities, the Internet Archive started archiving GeoCities websites. Apparently, another site that archived GeoCities is another web hosting site <i> geocities.ws. </i> If people want to edit their old GeoCities page now, they can gain access to it through geocities.ws. These websites downloaded as much content from the GeoCities websites before they were deleted, and created mirror pages of the originals. However the geocities.ws is the only option available to edit the contents again for now. But this is the case for GeoCities US branch, and GeoCities have actually still been working in Japan. Unfortunately, they are also shutting them in March 31 of this year.
